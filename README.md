## Learning objectives
- Learn how to create classes.
- Creating objects and using them.
- Some basic error handling.


## The Mission
We are going to make a tiny console bank program. The goal is to use classes and objects to handle logic and avoid duplicate code (i'm looking at you previous challenge).

We need to know a few things before we can continue.

## Must have Features
A working Client and BankAccount class with some properties and methods in the console. Either hardcoded or with interaction in ReadLine.


The Client class
- A constructor

- Properties:
    - Id
    - Name
    - Date joined

The bank account class
- A constructor

- Properties:
    - Client
    - Balance
    - Type

- Methods:
    - CheckBalance
    - Withdraw
    - Deposit


### Must have progression
- :heavy_check_mark: Client class
  - ✓  constructor
  - ✓ properties
    - ✓ id
    - ✓ Name
    - ✓ Date joined


### The end goal?
In the main function of the program you will create a Client and his/her bankAccount.
Here you will then make different deposits and withdrawals.
